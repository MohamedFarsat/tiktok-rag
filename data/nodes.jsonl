Theyâre all about keeping you safe, respecting human rights, and supporting a creative and welcoming community. We developed these principles with the foundational goal of preventing harm and enabling expression.\nAt times, we have to make difficult tradeoffs between competing goals. When that happens, we approach the decision thoughtfully and rely on trusted guidance, including:\nInternationally recognized global human rights standards\nFeedback from our community and Advisory Councils\nInput from experts in online safety, public health, and related fields\nHere are the eight principles:\nPrevent Harm: Keeping TikTok safe and fun is our top priority. Harm can look differentâit might be physical, emotional, or even financial. To strike the right balance with free expression, we restrict content only when necessary and in a way that seeks to minimize the impact on speech.\nSupport Free Expression: TikTok thrives on creativity. We honor this principle by providing the opportunity to share freely on our platform, while also proactively addressing behavior that can inhibit the speech of others. However, free expression isn't an absolute right. It's always considered in proportion to the potential harm, and can result in your content being removed or not recommended in the FYF.\nEncourage Kindness and Respect: We aim to foster a space where people treat each other with empathy and dignity. Our approach is designed to help prevent content that demeans or dehumanizes others, making TikTok a safer and more welcoming place for everyone.\nRespect Local Cultures: People use TikTok in over 150 countries. We work with local experts to make sure that our global approach considers the way harms are experienced across regions, and that we allow for regional applications of our guidelines while upholding human rights standards.\nChampion Inclusion: We celebrate the diverse cultures and experiences that make up our TikTok community. We also recognize that some communities have historically faced barriers to participation and expression, and weâre committed to reducing disproportionate harms.\nProtect Privacy : We are committed to protecting the privacy of our community and anyone shown or discussed on the platform. We strive to ensure that content doesn't expose anyoneâs personal information or invade their intimate privacy.\nBe Transparent and Consistent : We want everyone to know what our rules and standards are, and how we apply them. We seek to provide clear notice of our policies and practices, to apply them consistently, and to share our enforcement efforts at our Transparency Center .\nAct Fairly: E", "page_title": "Community Guidelines  | TikTok", "source": "tiktok_community_guidelines", "retrieved_at": "2026-01-11T10:42:43Z", "platforms": ["tiktok"]}

This is who we mean when we refer to âyouthâ or âyoung peopleâ in these Community Guidelines. To help keep the platform safer for this age group, we:\nSet age limits for certain features (like needing to be 16+ for your videos to appear in the FYF, or to use Direct Messages)\nUse more restrictive privacy settings by default for younger users\nLimit content that may not be appropriate for people under 18, with content filters and other safeguards . Learn more about this kind of content in the âAge-Restrictedâ sections throughout these Community Guidelines.\nAge Restrictions and Safety Features\nYou need to be at least 13 years old to create a TikTok account. In some countries, the minimum age may be different based on local laws. In the United States, there is a separate under-13 TikTok experience that includes extra protections like:\nRestricting interactive features that enable users to directly engage with others, such as commenting on content, messaging, sharing their videos, or maintaining an online profile\nFYF with content thatâs age-appropriate, as assessed by Common Sense Networks\nA dedicated Privacy Policy\nIf you create a new account in the United States and are under 13, you will automatically enter into this experience.\nWe remove accounts when we believe the user is under the minimum age required to have one. If we believe someone isnât old enough for features with a minimum age requirement, weâll restrict their access to those features. If your account was removed and you think it was a mistake, you can file an appeal . Anyone can report an account they believe belongs to someone whoâs too young to have an accountâeither in the app or online .\nWe know that parents sometimes post content featuring their children. If you do so, it needs to be clear that the account belongs to an adult. The bio, profile picture, or username are good places to do this.\nYouth Safety Enforcement\nWe donât allow content that could harm young people âphysically, emotionally, or developmentally. If we become aware an account holder has committed a sexual offense against a young person, we will ban the account , as well as any other accounts belonging to that person. We report incidents of youth sexual abuse and exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.\nLearn more at our Teen Safety Center and Guardianâs Guide .", "page_title": "Community Guidelines  | TikTok", "source": "tiktok_community_guidelines", "retrieved_at": "2026-01-11T10:42:43Z", "platforms": ["tiktok"]}

Pretending to be someone else or streaming someone elseâs content without permission may also lead to restrictions.\nIn multi-guest LIVE sessions, if a guest shares anything that breaks the rules, theyâll be removed from the session, and the creator may lose access to guest features temporarily. In severe situations, the room may be stopped. If a guest shares content thatâs FYF ineligible, the LIVE will be removed from the FYF.\nLastly, LIVE creators are responsible for anything that happens during their sessionsâeven when it involves third-party tools like voice-to-text software, real-time translation, or on-screen comment displays. For example, if a voice-to-text tool reads out a harmful comment, the creator is still accountable for enabling that feature. Creators should actively monitor and manage any tools they use to help prevent violations. Repeated issues related to third-party tools may lead to restrictions on using LIVE or LIVE features.\nLearn more about how to report a LIVE here .\nLIVE Features and Monetization\nLIVE is a monetizable feature through which you can earn rewards from TikTok.

We may also age-restrict content that focuses on human corpses with these severe injuries or violent deaths of a person that show blood. We make a distinction between dramatised violence featuring real human actors and content featuring animations or video games. Dramatised violence featuring real human actors may be more likely to face age restrictions, especially if the content is particularly graphic or realistic.

To have this warning expire after 90 days, you can take optional policy training . However, if your content violates the same policy within that 90-day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike.\nSometimes a single case of severe abuse will result in channel termination without warning. If you think that we made a mistake, you can submit an appeal .\nPolicy training sessions are short in-product educational experiences based on the specific Community Guidelines policy that you have violated.\nIf you receive a Community Guidelines warning, you can access the policy training from the YouTube app and your Studio account anywhere that you typically check your policy violations. This includes the Studio dashboard and the Content tab. You'll also see a link to open the training session from the email and banner notifications. Note: Not all Community Guidelines warnings are eligible for policy training.\nIf you complete the optional policy training, your warning will expire after 90 days. The 90-day period starts from when the training has been completed, not when the warning was issued.
