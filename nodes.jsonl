Theyâre all about keeping you safe, respecting human rights, and supporting a creative and welcoming community. We developed these principles with the foundational goal of preventing harm and enabling expression.\nAt times, we have to make difficult tradeoffs between competing goals. When that happens, we approach the decision thoughtfully and rely on trusted guidance, including:\nInternationally recognized global human rights standards\nFeedback from our community and Advisory Councils\nInput from experts in online safety, public health, and related fields\nHere are the eight principles:\nPrevent Harm: Keeping TikTok safe and fun is our top priority. Harm can look differentâit might be physical, emotional, or even financial. To strike the right balance with free expression, we restrict content only when necessary and in a way that seeks to minimize the impact on speech.\nSupport Free Expression: TikTok thrives on creativity. We honor this principle by providing the opportunity to share freely on our platform, while also proactively addressing behavior that can inhibit the speech of others. However, free expression isn't an absolute right. It's always considered in proportion to the potential harm, and can result in your content being removed or not recommended in the FYF.\nEncourage Kindness and Respect: We aim to foster a space where people treat each other with empathy and dignity. Our approach is designed to help prevent content that demeans or dehumanizes others, making TikTok a safer and more welcoming place for everyone.\nRespect Local Cultures: People use TikTok in over 150 countries. We work with local experts to make sure that our global approach considers the way harms are experienced across regions, and that we allow for regional applications of our guidelines while upholding human rights standards.\nChampion Inclusion: We celebrate the diverse cultures and experiences that make up our TikTok community. We also recognize that some communities have historically faced barriers to participation and expression, and weâre committed to reducing disproportionate harms.\nProtect Privacy : We are committed to protecting the privacy of our community and anyone shown or discussed on the platform. We strive to ensure that content doesn't expose anyoneâs personal information or invade their intimate privacy.\nBe Transparent and Consistent : We want everyone to know what our rules and standards are, and how we apply them. We seek to provide clear notice of our policies and practices, to apply them consistently, and to share our enforcement efforts at our Transparency Center .\nAct Fairly: Evaluating millions of pieces of content each day is a complex effort, but weâre committed to being impartial, clear, and providing opportunities to appeal.\nIn rare and exceptional situationsâsuch as crises or moments of social unrestâwe may adjust our usual enforcement or rules to protect our community and address emerging harms, while remaining guided by our principles."}

This is who we mean when we refer to âyouthâ or âyoung peopleâ in these Community Guidelines. To help keep the platform safer for this age group, we:\nSet age limits for certain features (like needing to be 16+ for your videos to appear in the FYF, or to use Direct Messages)\nUse more restrictive privacy settings by default for younger users\nLimit content that may not be appropriate for people under 18, with content filters and other safeguards . Learn more about this kind of content in the âAge-Restrictedâ sections throughout these Community Guidelines.\nAge Restrictions and Safety Features\nYou need to be at least 13 years old to create a TikTok account. In some countries, the minimum age may be different based on local laws. In the United States, there is a separate under-13 TikTok experience that includes extra protections like:\nRestricting interactive features that enable users to directly engage with others, such as commenting on content, messaging, sharing their videos, or maintaining an online profile\nFYF with content thatâs age-appropriate, as assessed by Common Sense Networks\nA dedicated Privacy Policy\nIf you create a new account in the United States and are under 13, you will automatically enter into this experience.\nWe remove accounts when we believe the user is under the minimum age required to have one. If we believe someone isnât old enough for features with a minimum age requirement, weâll restrict their access to those features. If your account was removed and you think it was a mistake, you can file an appeal . Anyone can report an account they believe belongs to someone whoâs too young to have an accountâeither in the app or online .\nWe know that parents sometimes post content featuring their children. If you do so, it needs to be clear that the account belongs to an adult. The bio, profile picture, or username are good places to do this.\nYouth Safety Enforcement\nWe donât allow content that could harm young people âphysically, emotionally, or developmentally. If we become aware an account holder has committed a sexual offense against a young person, we will ban the account , as well as any other accounts belonging to that person. We report incidents of youth sexual abuse and exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ). We also report to relevant law enforcement authorities when there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.\nLearn more at our Teen Safety Center and Guardianâs Guide ."}

Thatâs why we donât allow certain types of body exposure or sexualized behavior , including:\nNudity or sexual activity\nSexually suggestive acts or significant body exposure involving youth\nWhile we generally donât allow adult nudity or sexual activity, we make limited exceptions for documentaries, sex education, fiction, and art.

We also understand that what's considered \"suggestive\" varies by region.\nNudity : Being unclothed and showing body parts that are typically covered based on cultural norms.\nSignificant Body Exposure : Being mostly unclothed or nearly nude.

We remove misinformation primarily about vaccines when public health authorities conclude that the information is false and likely to directly contribute to imminent vaccine refusals. They include:\nVaccines cause autism (Ex: “Increased vaccinations are why so many kids have autism these days.”)\nVaccines cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (Ex: “Don’t you know vaccines cause SIDS?”\nVaccines cause the disease against which they are meant to protect, or cause the person receiving the vaccine to be more likely to get the disease (Ex: “Taking a vaccine actually makes you more likely to get the disease since there’s a strain of the disease inside. Beware!”)\nVaccines or their ingredients are deadly, toxic, poisonous, harmful, or dangerous (Ex: “Sure, you can take vaccines, if you don’t mind putting poison in your body.”)\nNatural immunity is safer than vaccine-acquired immunity (Ex: “It’s safest to just get the disease rather than the vaccine.”)\nIt is dangerous to get several vaccines in a short period of time, even if that timing is medically recommended (Ex: “Never take more than one vaccine at the same time, that is dangerous - I don’t care what your doctor tells you!”)\nVaccines are not effective at preventing the disease against which they purport to protect.  However, for the COVID-19, flu, and malaria vaccines, we do not remove claims that those vaccines are not effective in preventing someone from contracting those viruses. (Ex’s: Remove – “The polio vaccine doesn’t do anything to stop you from getting the disease”; Remove – “Vaccines actually don’t do anything to stop you from getting diseases”; Allow – “The vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting COVID-19, that’s why you still need to socially distance and wear a mask when you’re around others.”)\nAcquiring measles cannot cause death (requires additional information and/or context) (Ex: “Don’t worry about whether you get measles, it can’t be fatal.”)\nVitamin C is as effective as vaccines in preventing diseases for which vaccines exist.\nMisinformation about health during public health emergencies. We remove misinformation during public health emergencies when public health authorities conclude that the information is false and likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent physical harm, including by contributing to the risk of individuals getting or spreading a harmful disease or refusing an associated vaccine. We identify public health emergencies in partnership with global and local health authorities.\nPromoting or advocating for harmful miracle cures for health issues.

For content that does not otherwise violate the Community Standards, we may place an informative label on the face of content – or reject content submitted as an advertisement – when the content is a photorealistic image or video, or realistic sounding audio, that was digitally created or altered and creates a particularly high risk of materially deceiving the public on a matter of public importance."}
